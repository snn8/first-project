    <p class="last-trip">
      My last trip was to Koprivshtitsa - a small town, famous for its
      historical importance. It's been years since I last travelled by train in
      Bulgaria and it is a special kind of experience. The scenery, green
      forests, high mountain peaks and the wide blue sky - all of that
      captivates you with its beauty.

        <h3>My arrival</h3>
        <p class="my-arrival">
          It was a 2-hour trip by train from Sofia to Koprivshtitsa. The moment
          I arrived in the town, I was mesmerised by the view - numerous tiny
          houses surrounded by a magnificent mountain range. I felt
          insignificant in comparison to nature and its mighty presense. It
          serves as a reality check.

        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p class="first-day">
          I spent the first day exploring the central town area. I took a long
          walk by the river which goes through Koprivshtitsa and separates it in
          two. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing and birds were singing
          joyfully. Looking at this beautiful scenery, I wanted to capture it
          with my camera.

        <h3>Museums</h3>
        <p class="museum">
          On the second day I visited several museums. As I was crossing the
          threshold of those old traditional houses, my mind was going back in
          time and imagining the life people had. I was bombarded with all kinds
          of emotions. It felt as if the houses were alive and they were sharing 
          their stories with me.

        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        <p class="second-day">
          The significance of the town comes from its history. Many poets and
          revolutionaries, who played an important role for Bulgaria's
          liberation and independence, were born in Koprivshtitsa. Their homes
          are now turned into museums and attract tourists.

        <h3>Hill tops</h3>
        <p class="grave-1">
          The tiny steep streets were leading me to hidden places. I could
          easily lose a sense of time and space wandering around and capturing
          those stunning views with my lenses. Looking at the hill tops nearby,
          I was propelled to reach them.

        <h3>My last day</h3>
        <p class="third-day">
          The time passed unnoticed. My last day in Koprivshtitsa was dedicated
          to the museums that were located on the other side of the river. The
          last house I visited was up on a hill, revealing a breathtaking view
          of the whole town. What a better way to end my trip?
